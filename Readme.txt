This is an image annotation tool developed for our lab.

If you wanna reuse it, set it up in this way:

1. put your images under "images" folder;

2. put your score files of the images under "score_file" folder (actually, you can put it anywhere, cause you need to locate it in the software); the file format is fixed here, and I put a example file in that folder, so you may need to spend some time to transform.

3. run the software in "bin" folder, load a score file, set your parameters and enter start button; the annotation result file is in "result_file" folder;

If any wrong happens when you use this software, it may be because of that the image path in the score file is not compatible with images' real path, and check to make sure that you have the right score file format.


Since this software is finished in two days, it's not so friendly in UI and may include some mistakes. Feel free to mail your questions to zhangctou@gmail.com .If you want to reuse it with your lab experiments, I may also provide some help on redesigning it a little bit.
